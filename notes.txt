v0: RM bonus = scaled velocity_tracking reward. Very high frequency gait

v1: Add penalty to RM bonus for torque. Wild behavior.

v2: RM bonus = scaled computed_reward. Frequency kinda high, foot clearance low.

v3: RM bonus = v3 but feet_air_time =  10.0. Same behavior as v2.

v4: feet_air_time = 100.0. Robot lies on ground, lifts feet up

v5: RM transition only happens when foot clearance > 0.05 (ground is 0.02)
		Works, but back feet dont move forward much.
		Increasing commanded velocity causes robot to stand still

v6: reward from energy min paper, plus 0.05 foot clearance
		Works, but gait is awkward and walking in circles


v7: Removed foot clearance still awkward, still going in circles, base height very low.

v8: Base height reward. x_vel_error -30 instead of -20. Train for 2k iters.
	Didnt fix anything

v9: simplify reward. linear_vel coefficient increase to 10. 
	Works, very high frequency, and awkward.
	** NOTHING LEARNED UNTIL 2K ITERS

v10: v9 but enforce 0.05 foot clearance, 5k iters.
	Falls over.

	Remove 0.05 clearance, try bouncing gait (same otherwise as v9).
	Command vel only 0.9. bounced in circle, very awkward

v11: v9 but over more complex terrain
	Falls immediately...
	Try less challenging terrain: Still falls
	energy coefficient 0.01, refactor code
		Works, frequency is good, but position is awkward (back legs weird, base low)
			Trained for 1500 iters of 2k envs

v12:
	v11 but harder terrain
	position still awkward

v13:
	v12 but restrict hip joint movement (action scale less for hips)
	Better, but back legs don't swing forward enough. Also, base height is low.

v14:
	v13 but base height reward term (-10 not enough)
	more significant penalty (-100)
	Base is very tilted to reach base height. Back legs still extended
	Base orientation penalty instead of base height penalty
	Base orientation is fixed, but now base height is very low. Back lefgs still extended
	Add base height penalty
	Works, but back legs still extended...

v15:
	Somehow enforce back legs not exteneded out so far. 

	Add backward commands

	Now back legs are good, but front legs fully extended

		**This works. Now 

v16:

	train on forward and backward commands, only 0.9 and -0.9

to try:

	- enforce foot clearance
	- Train on more iters
	- tune linear vel coefficient
	- Add challenging terrain
