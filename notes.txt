v0: RM bonus = scaled velocity_tracking reward. Very high frequency gait

v1: Add penalty to RM bonus for torque. Wild behavior.

v2: RM bonus = scaled computed_reward. Frequency kinda high, foot clearance low.

v3: RM bonus = v3 but feet_air_time =  10.0. Same behavior as v2.

v4: feet_air_time = 100.0. Robot lies on ground, lifts feet up

v5: RM transition only happens when foot clearance > 0.05 (ground is 0.02)
		Works, but back feet dont move forward much.
		Increasing commanded velocity causes robot to stand still

v6: reward from energy min paper, plus 0.05 foot clearance
		Works, but gait is awkward and walking in circles


v7: Removed foot clearance still awkward, still going in circles, base height very low.

v8: Base height reward. x_vel_error -30 instead of -20. Train for 2k iters.
	Didnt fix anything

v9: simplify reward. linear_vel coefficient increase to 10. 
	Works, very high frequency, and awkward.
	** NOTHING LEARNED UNTIL 2K ITERS

v10: v9 but enforce 0.05 foot clearance, 5k iters

to try:

	- enforce foot clearance
	- Train on more iters
	- tune linear vel coefficient
	- Add challenging terrain
